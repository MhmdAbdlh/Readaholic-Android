Willow Wilson\\n             Set in 1491 during the reign of the last sultanate in the Iberian peninsula, \\n             The Bird King is the story of Fatima, the only remaining Circassian concubine to the sultan, and her dearest friend Hassan, the palace mapmaker. \\n              Hassan has a secret--he can draw maps of places he's never seen and bend the shape of reality.\\n              When representatives of the newly formed Spanish monarchy arrive to negotiate the sultan's surrender, Fatima befriends one of the women, not realizing that she will see Hassan's gift as sorcery and a threat to Christian Spanish rule. With their freedoms at stake,\\n               what will Fatima risk to save Hassan and escape the palace walls? As Fatima and Hassan traverse Spain with the help of a clever jinn to find safety, The Bird King asks us to consider what love is and the price of freedom at a time when the West and the Muslim world were not yet separate. \",\"reviews_count\":0,\"ratings_count\":0,\"ratings_avg\":0,\"author_id\":1,\"pages_no\":0,\"created_at\":\"2019-05-03 08:40:28\",\"updated_at\":\"2019-05-03 08:40:28\",\"genre\":\"Young Adult,Historical,Fiction,Adult\"}]}";
